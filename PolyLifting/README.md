# Polynomial Lifting


To recreate the Newton fractals shown in Figure 2 of [1], run
```
python fractal.py
```
The settings at the top of the file can be adjusted to choose between the different plots.

---

To recreate the plot shown in Figure 7 of [1], run
```
python x16_example.py
```
The settings at the top of the file can be adjusted to choose between the residual convergence and convergence with respect to step lengts.

---

To recreate the benchmark results given in Table 1 of [1], run
```
python random_poly.py
```
---

To recreate the convergence plot for the Rosenbrock function shown in Figure 8 of [1], run
```
python rosenbrock_2d.py
```
